# About SignalBox

SignalBox is a web application application designed to make it easy to run clinical and other studies. Signalbox makes it easy to recruit, take consent from, and follow-up large numbers of participants, using a customisable assessment schedule.

Participants can provide self-report data via email, telephone, or SMS message. Study coordinators can login to a secure administration website to manage studies and check participation. The admin interface integrates online and offline elements of a study; researchers can enter addtional datapoints collected offline or in the lab, and there is full support for double entry and reconciling of paper-based data, and also for audit trails of changes to participant data.

# Studies using SignalBox

<a name="studies"><a>

Signalbox was designed to replace the numerous, ad-hoc systems which have been developed by research groups, providing a flexible, secure, and well-tested system.

The software has been independently audited, and used in many numerous studies, including a large, MRC-funded clinical trial (<http://www.reframed.org.uk>).
